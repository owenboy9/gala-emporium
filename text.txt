day one (present: Zeinab, Erik, Micke, owen; Lovisa on the phone). 

we begun by imagining the venue's functionality in general: it's a space all the different clubs can rent (we couldn't agree upon whether the venue will serve cocktails or not, for example).
to make that simpler, we sketched very general wireframes (main page, club page, event page; owen insisted on sketching a cocktail menu & venue concept wireframe). questions that arose from discussing those were:
1) if the venue ends up hosting, say, 20 clubs, how do we present them (we want to have clubs' logos/pics/etc on our homepage, linked to the clubs' pages) on our homepage? we came up with the idea of rotating display: the clubs that are active, say, this week come to the top of a scrollable list.
2) if we choose to offer a standardized html-css club page scaffolding, what components will be obligatory for the club owners to provide? we made a preliminary list thereof (background pic + more visuals, name, description, events, gala emporiumâ€™s logo, logo (also reusable for the general event calendar), color palette)
3) ideally, we would work with databases: separate ones for clubs and events? probably just one database.
4) event calendar on our homepage: preferably a full week's events always visible; tonight's event highlighted. scrollable list of upcoming stuff.

we decided four of us would come up with, design, and code their own club's page, and one of us (owen) would take care of the venue's site (homepage). 

we are discussing pros and cons of a one-pager solution versus separate html club sites

in more measurable terms, we have:
1) set up a github repository
2) set up a trello workspace
3) chosen a scrum master (Lovisa)
4) had a focused workflow planning meeting
